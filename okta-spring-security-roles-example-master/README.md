## Okta + Groups with Spring Security

This example uses the [Okta Spring Boot Spring Security Starter](https://github.com/okta/okta-spring-security) in
conjunction with the [Okta SignIn Widget](https://github.com/okta/okta-signin-widget).

It demonstrates how you can connect Okta Groups to Spring Security Roles. You can then limit access to methods in
controllers and services based on membership in groups.
